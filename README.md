## Hello World, Iâ€™m @monmm! ðŸ‘‹

I'm an aspiring software engineer based in Mexico City.  
I have great interest in full-stack development,  
machine learning,  business administration,  
and everything in between.

:woman_technologist: I'm currently a third year **CS** major at **UNAM**.  

Here are some technologies I've been working with:  
* Java    
* Python  
* Haskell 
* HTML & CSS
* Javascript   
* Elixir     
  
  
> Outside of work,  
> I'm interested in following the developments of science.  
> I also play a lot of video games and like to learn from other cultures.
